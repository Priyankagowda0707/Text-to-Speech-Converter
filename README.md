🚀 Built a Fully Responsive Text-to-Speech Converter! 🗣️💻

        I recently created an interactive Text-to-Speech Converter that lets users enter any text and instantly hear it read aloud 🎧✨.

💡 Key Highlights:

        📝 User-Friendly Interface – A clean text area at the top where users can enter long text to be converted.

        🎯 One-Click Conversion – Just hit the Convert to Speech button and hear the magic! 🔊

       📱 Fully Responsive Design – Works seamlessly across mobiles, tablets, and desktops.

       🎨 Attractive UI – Styled for simplicity and usability.

       ⚡ Instant Playback – No delays, the speech starts right away.

🛠 Tech Stack Used:

      🌐 HTML5 – For structuring the application.

      🎨 CSS3 – For styling and making it responsive.

     ⚙️ JavaScript (Web Speech API) – For converting text into speech and handling playback.

✨ This project demonstrates how simple web technologies can be used to create interactive and accessible tools for everyone.
